                    <h4>LCC History</h4>
                    <p>La Concepcion College, Inc. (LCC) is founded in 1998, a non-sectarian higher education
                        institution with a young nucleus of rich academic, cultural, and athletic achievements offering
                        academic programs from Pre-Kindergarten, Elementary, Junior High School, Senior High School,
                        Vocational, to College Courses, the school is strategically situated in the heart of the
                        fast-growing City of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, Philippines.</p>
                    <h5><b>Humble Beginnings</b></h5>
                    <p>LCC takes pride in its founders who are experienced educators and leaders. LCC is a product of
                        good chemistry of the spouses Mr. Francisco C. Magpantay from Batangas and Dr. Loreto F.
                        Magpantay from Ilocos Sur.
                        The drive of putting up a school comes naturally to Dr. Loreto F. Magpantay. Her early
                        experiences as a classroom teacher in a public school enabled her to have first-hand experiences
                        of the prevailing congestion and other issues in public schools. Dr. Magpantay believed that
                        there is great power in education for the development of our nation, and the attainment of this
                        power should not be hindered, rather it should be supported. While on the other hand, Mr.
                        Francisco C. Magpantay, who is a natural leader with professional experiences as a policeman in
                        the Philippine Constabulary, is known for his good people skills. He has been a consistent
                        leader in most of the associations he belongs to. With limited funds but with high hopes of
                        helping his neighbors, he put up a two-story commercial building in their own house located the
                        heart of Barangay Narra Francisco Homes, City of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. Various types of
                        businesses rented stalls and rooms, but a certain room is vacant for some time, no one seemed to
                        be interested to occupy.
                    <p>
                    <p>Coming from two different professional backgrounds, the spouses’ individual endeavors turned out
                        to be a synergy. Despite the limited funds, the founders’ strong guts, determination, and heart
                        of a genuine educator and leader, Dr. Magpantay and Mr. Magpantay braved to put up a school. The
                        vacant room in commercial building marks the history of La Concepcion College, Inc. The humble
                        beginnings of LCC commenced in 1997 with the establishment of a daycare center in a 47 square
                        meters vacant room. The name of the school was Little Angels’ Daycare Center in 1997. With
                        seventeen (17) pioneer pupils, the daycare center was graced with its first teacher, Ms. Nancy
                        P. Magkilat and sometimes voluntarily assisted by one of the dynamic parents, Ms. Maria Luisa E.
                        Estopace, who then becomes part of the school and played a key element in the growth of LCC.
                        A year after, due to positive, encouraging feedback, and demand of the parents for a higher
                        level of learning, on February 28, 1998, the daycare center developed into a formal school. A
                        new school name was coined after the birth date of the founder’s first daughter, Ms. Noime F.
                        Magpantay – December 8 or the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Hence, the name of the school
                        was La Concepcion Learning Academy (LCLA) that is awarded the Government Recognition by the then
                        Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS).</p>
                    <h5><b>The Birth of LCC</b></h5>
                    <p>In 2001, due to the hard work of the administrators, teaching, and non-teaching staff, collegiate
                        courses were offered and finally La Concepcion College, Inc.(LCC) was established as approved by
                        the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). LCC is one of the pioneering tertiary education
                        institutions in Francisco Homes and in the City of San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan. The desire of
                        founders to help those self-supporting students who are in dire need of assistance made way to
                        establish a college that openly accommodates high school and college working students. Both of
                        the founders came from the same situation, and believe that these students should be supported.
                        The College is truly an oasis of less-privileged yet high potential students.
                        In 2006 with LCC’s dynamic College Dean, Dr. Nestor Edilberto Costales Jr., LCC had its major
                        era; noted college degree and technical programs were granted with Government Recognitions from
                        CHED and TESDA.
                        Also in 2006, a new, wider and more accessible additional campus in Kaypian Road, corner Quirino
                        Highway was acquired. A record-breaking first year of operation was noted, offering primary,
                        secondary, and tertiary courses, the population of the College reached a thousand in its first
                        year of operation.
                        At a very young age, and with its two campuses (Francisco Homes Campus and Kaypian Campus), LCC
                        takes pride producing top of the line graduates and winners with highly competitive knowledge
                        and skills. This accomplishment is evidenced by the high performance of its graduates in the
                        licensure examinations, particularly in the field of education and criminology, well-employed
                        graduates, and continuous championships in academic, sports, and cultural in competitions.</p>

                    <h4>Vision and Mission</h4>
                    <p class="text-center">La Concepcion College envisions herself to be one of the forefront
                        educational institutions that serves as catalyst of change for the holistic development of the
                        community, the country, and the ASEAN region. <br><br>

                        Inspired by the motherly care and ideals of Mary Immaculate Conception and guided by the core
                        values that befits a true LCCian, LCC dedicates herself in the pursuit of her purpose of
